## Setup Instructions

### Backend

The backend of this project uses the Java programming language. To implement and run the project locally, the following are the step to step setup instructions:

- Use the STS IDE to import the clone of this project as a Maven Project. - Update the Maven Projct to have all required packages installed as jars.

- Check the pom.xml file to ensure you have the "spring-boot-starter-web", the "spring-boot-starter-data-jpa" and apache-derby dependancy.

- Run the simple test class below provided by SpringBoot to have the application return the string "Hi" on the URL http://localhost:8080/hello

            import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;
            import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

            @RestController //Annotation to notify that this is a Spring Application
            public class HelloController {

                    @RequestMapping("/hello") //Annotation for the GET method to indicate the routing path
                    public String sayHi() {

  return "Hi";
  }
  }

- If everything up this point seems fine run the application and test the api endpoint http://localhost:8080/products/ using postman to POST, GET, UPDATE and DELETE dummy data.

### Frontend

ReactJS was used to build the user interface for the web application to handle the view layer. ReactJS makes dynamic web pages and also allows for reusable components. To set the frontend of this application.
After creating SuperMatt CRUD APISs using spring boot on the main souecr folder navigate into the main/resources folder and create a webapp folder cd into it and clone the frontend repo into webapp. Run npm install to install all required dependancies described on the package.json file.
Dependancies include the following:

- npx-react-app supermatt-frontend
- npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
- npm install --save react-router-dom
- npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
- npm install --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
- npm install --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
- npm install axios

## BDD

Using the services on the application, the idea is to have clients able to add new products to the inventory, update existing items, delete exising items and view all products in the inventory.

### APIs

<img src="images/api.png">

The development of APIs applies the Richardson Maturity Model to measure level RESTfulness which includes

- Level 3 - Applies the Haetous model using the rel and href attributes.
- Level 2 - Applies status codes.
- Level 1 - Individual URI for each resource.
- Level 0 - Not RESTful.

The decisons made about the API aims to accomplish easy deployment of APIs, Scaling, Flexibility and Technology agnosticity. Some of the features are as follows:

#### GET

The GET method retrieves data in JSON data format. On the frontend, the get method populates the a table with all the products stored in the database. In CRUD operations this is READ.

#### POST

The POST method adds items to the data in the database and takes in input as JSON. On successful post, the entry is added to the table. In CRUD operations this is CREATE.

#### PUT

The PUT method updates an existing record on the DB using its unique ID to retrieve, edit and post the new data. In CRUD operations this is UPDATE.

#### DELETE

The DELETE method deletes a record identified using its ID and permanently removes it from the DB. In CRUD operations this is DELETE.

### Data

Ordinarily the data should come into the queue from a JBBC database however in the interest of accomplishing the logic of the services in this project, an Apache Derby volatile Database is used which refreshs to null on each deployment.

### Future Modifications

- A relational POSTGRESQL Database will be introduced.
- Implement API metadata headers that allows for authentication using objects such as API Keys, also incude Cookies in the metadata to increase API fetch efficiency. The metadata data should be to provide the following information depending on the request.

- 200 - Okay (GET, DELETE, POST).
- 201 - Message created (POST).
- 204 - Message deleted (DELETE).
- 302 - Resource found.
- 304 - Resource not modified.
- 307 - Temporary redirected.
- 400 - Bad request (PUT, POST).
- 401 - Unauthorised request.
- 403 - Forbidden request.
- 404 - Resource not found (GET, DELETE, PUT).
- 415 - Unsupported media type (PUT, POST).
- 500 - Internal server error (GET, DELETE, PUT, POST).
